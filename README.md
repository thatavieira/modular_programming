Modular Programming allows the creation of Systems that are scalable, adaptable, reusable, correct and secure. 
This means that modules in a system, once tested and verified, can be used by other systems, or connected to new modules to extend the current system.
Concepts of inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, generic types, and event-driven programming.
